cpp Linux project with the possibility to use the debugger under vs-code. 
There is also a library that is built and linked with cmake for demonstration purposes. 
The project is developed further and contains (later) branches.

Not only the CMakeLists.txt files are important, but also the use of the vs-code json files: launch, settings & tasks. It's also a good idea to use vs-code insiders rather than vs-code.
